In order for the mandelbrot executable to run, I think sfml must be installed.
I tried to statically link the libraries, but I had a lot of issues doing so. 
Once the application starts, use the mouse and left click and drag to select
an area of the image to zoom in to. Give the program time to generate and
load the new image, then you can zoom into another new area. If you right
click it will generate and load the standard mandelbrot image between
-2.5-i and 1+i. Currently there is no graphical indication of how long it will
take to generate the image. If you run the program from a command line, though,
it will display the progress in the terminal.

Alternatively you can use the command line and pass parameters to the program. 
From within the directory where the project is located the format is:
./generate   min_real   min_imaginary   max_real   max_imaginary   width_in_pixels   height_in_pixels

After it runs, you can then view mandelbrot.jpg which in generates in the same directory.
