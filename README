In order for the mandelbrot executable to run, I think sfml must be installed.
I tried to statically link the libraries, but I had a lot of issues doing so. 

Alternatively you can use the command line and pass parameters to the program. 
From within the directory where the project is cloned to the format is:
./generate   min_x   min_y   max_x   max_y   width_in_pixels   height_in_pixels

After it runs, you can then view mandelbrot.jpg which in generates in the same directory.
